My proficiency spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to build comprehensive solutions from start to finish. One of my significant projects is TryNutritions, an eCommerce platform designed to enhance user shopping experiences. This project, hosted at trynutritions.shop, utilizes Express and MongoDB for its backend and Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
